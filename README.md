# Solving-simple-damped-oscillation-ODE-with-PINN
Here, we explore the utilization of a simple parametric Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) in TensorFlow to solve the damped harmonic oscillator problem. The code is provided without warranties. Please see the attached Explanations file for further details about the problem, implementation, and results.
